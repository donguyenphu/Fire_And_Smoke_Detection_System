**Required Materials:
-1 Arduino uno R3
-1 Mini Breadboard 400 holes
-1 Mq-2 Smoke Sensor Module
-1 Flame Sensor Module
-1 Buzzer
-1 Single Channel Relay 5v
-1 Mini DC Submersible Water
-3 Male to Male Jumper Wires
-9 Female to Male Jumper Wiress
**Mechanism: 
-When smoke goes in, the Mq-2 Smoke Sensor will detect
-When flame or fire goes in, the Flames Sensor will detect
-Either Mq-2 Sensor or Flames Sensor detects, the relay will convey the signal to the mini dc submersible water to spray water.
